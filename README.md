# Tailwind CSS hover directive issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS hover directives.  The hover state is not applying correctly due to an error in how the directives are used in the code. 

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.
